<h1 id="client">Client Server</h1>
<p>Client-server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients.[1] Often clients and servers communicate over a computer network on separate hardware, but both client and server may reside in the same system. A server host runs one or more server programs, which share their resources with clients. A client usually does not share any of its resources, but it requests content or service from a server. Clients, therefore, initiate communication sessions with servers, which await incoming requests. Examples of computer applications that use the client-server model are email, network printing, and the World Wide Web. 
Client and server role

The "client-server" characteristic describes the relationship of cooperating programs in an application. The server component provides a function or service to one or many clients, which initiate requests for such services. Servers are classified by the services they provide. For example, a web server serves web pages and a file server serves computer files. A shared resource may be any of the server computer's software and electronic components, from programs and data to processors and storage devices. The sharing of resources of a server constitutes a service.

Whether a computer is a client, a server, or both, is determined by the nature of the application that requires the service functions. For example, a single computer can run a web server and file server software at the same time to serve different data to clients making different kinds of requests. The client software can also communicate with server software within the same computer.[2] Communication between servers, such as to synchronize data, is sometimes called inter-server or server-to-server communication.
Client and server communication

Generally, a service is an abstraction of computer resources and a client does not have to be concerned with how the server performs while fulfilling the request and delivering the response. The client only has to understand the response based on the well-known application protocol, i.e. the content and the formatting of the data for the requested service.

Clients and servers exchange messages in a request–response messaging pattern. The client sends a request, and the server returns a response. This exchange of messages is an example of inter-process communication. To communicate, the computers must have a common language, and they must follow rules so that both the client and the server know what to expect. The language and rules of communication are defined in a communications protocol. All protocols operate in the application layer. The application layer protocol defines the basic patterns of the dialogue. To formalize the data exchange even further, the server may implement an application programming interface (API).[3] The API is an abstraction layer for accessing a service. By restricting communication to a specific content format, it facilitates parsing. By abstracting access, it facilitates cross-platform data exchange.[4]

A server may receive requests from many distinct clients in a short period. A computer can only perform a limited number of tasks at any moment, and relies on a scheduling system to prioritize incoming requests from clients to accommodate them. To prevent abuse and maximize availability, the server software may limit the availability to clients. Denial of service attacks are designed to exploit a server's obligation to process requests by overloading it with excessive request rates. Encryption should be applied if sensitive information is to be communicated between the client and the server.

<h1 id="comp">Components of web applications</h1>
<p>All web-based database applications have three primary components: A web browser (or client), a web application server, and a database server.

Web-based database applications rely on a database server, which provides the data for the application. The database server sometimes also provides business logic in the form of stored procedures. Stored procedures can offer significant performance advantages, especially in a multi-tiered architecture. In addition to database servers, other enterprise information system components include IMS databases, IBM® MQ messages, and CICS® records.

The clients handle the presentation logic, which controls the way in which users interact with the application. In some cases, the client validates user-provided input. Web applications sometimes integrate Java™ applets into the client-side logic to improve the presentation layer.

Applet
    A Java program that is part of a Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) page. (HTML is the standard method for presenting web data to users.) Applets work with Java-enabled browsers, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer; they are loaded when the HTML page is processed.

Web application servers manage the business logic. The business logic, typically written in Java, supports multitiered applications. The web application server can manage requests from a variety of remote clients. The web application layer might include JavaServer Pages (JSP) files, Java servlets, Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) components, or web services.

JSP
    A technology that provides a consistent way to extend web server functionality and create dynamic web content. The web applications that you develop with JSP technology are server and platform independent.
Servlet
    A Java program that responds to client requests and generates responses dynamically.
EJB
    A component architecture for building distributed applications with the Java programming model. Server transactional components are reusable and provide portability across application servers.
Web services
    Self-contained, modular applications that provide an interface between the provider and the consumer of application resources. You can read more about web services later in this information.

Endless possibilities for web content

Web content development is the process of crafting all the information your website offers. It can involve everything from research and analysis to the creative design, writing, and editing processes, through formatting, organizing, and publishing the resulting content on the site.

In the early days of the web, content development generally meant taking existing documents and coding the text into HTML. But with today’s smart search engines, web content includes virtually anything that can be distributed by an HTTP server and viewed by a web browser.

That means not just the text on webpages and assets such as documents and PDFs, but also videos, audio recordings, images, animation, and other digital elements are now searchable. That opens up almost endless possibilities for ways to engage an audience and create leads through web content.



It’s a double-edged sword: There are virtually unlimited possibilities for creating web content — but that makes it a pretty daunting task, especially when you are not in the business of marketing or don’t have the resources to dedicate to full-time web development.

Thinking about existing content and ways you might repurpose assets you have already made an investment in is a great place to start.

But for truly engaging web content development, it is also important to have two things:

    Deep insights about your buyers (from buyer persona research)
    A strategy for creating purposeful content that gives visitors a reason to keep coming back to your website.

For professional support in creating your website and/or keeping it fresh, content development services offer expertise in everything you might need:

    Buyer persona and other helpful research
    Content strategy
    Graphic design
    Web content writing
    Technical writing
    SEO
    Social media
    Video and multimedia development

A web content development professional can help you create high-quality content that both expresses the uniqueness of your business and provides website visitors with an experience that is easy to use, informative, and inviting.
